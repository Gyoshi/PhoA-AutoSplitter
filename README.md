# PhoA-AutoSplitter
LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Phoenotopia: Awakening

Can automatically start and split the timer. You can choose which things you want to split on based on various 
- Tools and Upgrades
- Miscellaneous Flags
- Locations

Also calculates in-game time, which excludes time spent loading.

Feel free to @Gyoshi on the Discord [Phoenotopia Fan Server](https://discord.gg/Swd6zcTCQZ) for whatever

## Known Issues
- ~~Does not work if you launch the game after the autosplitter is loaded~~
    - I've applied a work-around, but let me know if you have trouble with this
    - The workaround unfortunately causes LiveSplit interface to lag (e.g. after editing splits)
- There might be a bug where spamming inputs (e.g. during cutscenes) can cause Gail to perform those inputs delayed (lemme know if you get this; it was probably just my pc being a potato)
- Only tested on version 1.3.3 of the game

Much love to Ero who helped me out a bunch on the Speedrun Tool Development discord
